["chesterton-thursday.txt", "[ The Man Who Was Thursday by G . K . Chesterton 1908 ] To Edmund Clerihew Bentley A cloud was on the mind of men , and wailing went the weather , Yea , a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boys together . Science announced nonentity and art admired decay ; The world was old and ended : but you and I were gay ; Round us in antic order their crippled vices came -- Lust that had lost its laughter , fear that had lost its shame . Like the white lock of Whistler , that lit our aimless gloom , Men showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume . Life was a fly that faded , and death a drone that stung ; The world was very old indeed when you and I were young ."]

He loved to dust his old grammars ; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality ."]
